            <p>When the acting, directing, screenplay, cinematography,
                and the total production value all work together to tell a single, compelling,
                and impactful tale, it is what defines a movie as "good."
                In short, a good movie employs all these techniques to create an emotionally engaging plot.
                A movie can also be specified as "good" or "the best" if it makes you feel intense emotions that
                you could only feel in real life. Genuine emotions are hard to conjure when the way in which those
                specific emotions
                are conjured on the basis of fantasy or a reenactment (acting). The prominent character (or main
                character), in any form,
                is the center of attention throughout the entire film. It should be audacious, flexible, and vivacious.
                There is no room for
                it to be unfinished in any way because it is the major focus. For instance, the information displayed
                must be accurate and not in doubt.
                Many excellent films are careful enough to make sure that every aspect of the character is impressive.
                Conflict is important as well.
                Every movie has a conflict, but not every one of them is ideal. The amount of drama and suspense in a
                dispute is determined by its intensity.
                Depending on the plot, the speed at which it is solved varies.</p>
